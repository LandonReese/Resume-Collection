# Library Book Tracking Web Application

## Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the project directory and execute the following command:

### `npm start`

This command launches the app in development mode and opens a new browser window at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can use this local environment to interact with the application.

While running the application, the page will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the code. Any lint errors will also be displayed in the console.

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a full-stack web application for managing library books. The application demonstrates the use of the MERN stack, comprising MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, to create a seamless user experience for library book tracking.

### Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The front-end of the application is built using React, providing a user-friendly and intuitive interface for library book management.

- **Data Communication:** The React front-end communicates with the Express server to perform various actions. Users can view available and checked-out books, check out books, and check in books seamlessly.

- **Full-Stack Capabilities:** This project showcases my full-stack development skills, including front-end design, data fetching, server communication, and database integration. It serves as a comprehensive demonstration of web development capabilities.
