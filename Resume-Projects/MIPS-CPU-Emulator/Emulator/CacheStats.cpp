/*******************************
 * A CacheStats.h class specification file, to which youâ€™ll need to add member variables 
 * A CacheStats.cpp class implementation file, which you should enhance with code to model the 
 * described cache and count accesses, misses, and writebacks
 * 
 * Every time an access is made to the cache model, the cache model should return the number of cycles that 
 * the processor must stall in order for that access to complete.  It takes 0 cycles to do a lookup or to hit in the 
 * cache (i.e., data that is hit will be returned or written immediately).  A read access to the next level of the 
 * memory hierarchy (e.g., main memory) has a latency of 30 cycles, and a write access has a latency of 10 
 * cycles.  Note that an access resulting in the replacement of a dirty line requires both a main memory write 
 * (to write back the dirty block) and a read (to fetch the new block) consecutively.  Because the cache has no 
 * write buffer, all stores must stall until the write is complete.
 * 
 * Inside your Stats class, add a new function similar to the bubble() and flush() functions.  This stall() 
 * function should stall the entire pipeline for a specified number of cycles.  The Stats class should track the 
 * total number of stall cycles that occur during program execution.
