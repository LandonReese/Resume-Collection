 * In addition to enhancing the CacheStats.h/.cpp skeleton, you will need to modify your existing 
 * Stats.h/Stats.cpp in order to implement memory stalls.  You will also need to modify CPU.h to 
 * instantiate a CacheStats object, and CPU.cpp to call both CacheStats and Stats class functions 
 * appropriately to model cache behavior and resulting pipeline stalls.  Youâ€™ll also need to change 
 * CPU::printFinalStats() to match my expected output format (see below).
